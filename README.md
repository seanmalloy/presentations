## Presentations
Here is where I keep all of my presentations. I'm using
the [Go present tool](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present).

## Install
```
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
```
## Customize
Files in the `base` directory can be updated to change to over all look
and feel of all presentations in this repo.

## Run
```
$ git clone ...
$ cd presentations
$ present -base ./base
```
